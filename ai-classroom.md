 - Rename: Learners can modify the name of a chatroom.
 - Delete: Learners can remove a chatroom.
 - Duplicate: Learners can create a copy of an existing chatroom with the same settings. Duplicating a chatroom will not copy over the chat history.

**Chatroom Settings:**

 - Select LLM: Learners can choose from a pool of available Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with within the chatroom.
 - Prompt Instructions (optional): Learners can provide additional guidance to the LLM by adding introductory text to their prompts. This can influence the LLM's response towards the desired outcome.

_Important Note: After sending the first message in a chatroom, learners cannot modify the LLM or prompt instructions. To change these settings, learners need to either duplicate the chatroom or create a new one._
